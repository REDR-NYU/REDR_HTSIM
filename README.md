# Recycled Entropy Deflection Routing
Modern Data Center Networks increasingly support mission-critical, latency-sensitive applications that require millisecond-scale resilience against frequent link failures. While traditional control plane mechanisms fail to meet these stringent convergence requirements, data plane Fast Rerouting (FRR) solutions, such as InFaRR, introduce significant architectural complexity through their reliance on intricate in-network Finite State Machines and resource-intensive mechanisms like Pushback and Loop Prevention. To address these operational inefficiencies, this report introduces Recycled Entropy Deflection Routing (REDR), a lightweight recovery paradigm that obviates the need for heavy switch-local-state maintenance by exploiting the entropy field inherent in ECMP routing. By offloading path validity computation to end-hosts which precalculate and embed valid backup entropy values directly into packet headers, REDR enables switches to deterministically deflect traffic via simplified match-action rules. Our evaluation demonstrates that REDR achieves fault tolerance robustness comparable to InFaRR while significantly mitigating the computational burden and processing overhead on network devices.
